    <p className="text-lg">
      Capacity Building is a conceptual approach to improve the knowledge
      and skills of an individual and teams for institutional or
      organizational development through training and workshops. The
      approaches focus on understanding the challenges to achieve
      development goals while enhancing their abilities to achieve
      measurable and sustainable results. It means much more than
      theoretical training as it includes practical learnings through
      contextualized activities. Capacity-building methods and techniques
      result in increased abilities of individuals, groups, and
      organisations to define and make strategic plans in align to their
      objectives and goals. It helps them to perform core functions, solve
      problems, and deal with development needs within a local context and
      in a sustainable manner.
