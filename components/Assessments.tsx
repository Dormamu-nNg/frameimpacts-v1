                A project for Data Processing and Data Analysis on the
                Applications of CM Elevate Schemes. To deliver the task, a
                scoring system was developed based on the key factors identified
                in the screening process of applicants. This system is efficient
                and effective in shortlisting the most promising candidates that
                meet the criteria. The scoring system ensures a fair practice of
                selection and more effective allocation of scheme grants.
